# ExplosionSimulating

### Based off the paper "Procedural Fluid Modeling of Explosion Phenomena Based on Physical Properties" by Genichi Kawada and Takashi Kanai

### The object of this project is to simulate both the fast and slow parts of explosions in reasonable computational time. We implement this using flow control paths and a grid data structure
